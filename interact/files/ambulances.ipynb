    "formula, even immediately after finishing a course (or several courses)\n",
    "on the subject. After leaving school or university, it is harder still\n",
    "to choose the right formula. Even many people who have taught statistics\n",
    "at the university level (including this writer) must look at a book to\n",
    "get the correct formula for a problem as simple as the ambulances, and\n",
    "then we are often still not sure we have the right answer. This is the\n",
    "grave disadvantage of the standard approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past few decades, resampling and other Monte Carlo simulation\n",
    "methods have come to be used extensively in scientific research. But in\n",
