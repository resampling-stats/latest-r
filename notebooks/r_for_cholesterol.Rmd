Calculate correlation coefficient for compliance and cholesterol.

```{r}
df <- read.csv('data/cholost.csv')
compliance <- df$percent_compliance
cholesterol <- df$cholesterol_decrease

# Compliance as standard scores.
dev_compliance <- compliance - mean(compliance)  # Deviations.
stdev_compliance <- sqrt(mean(dev_compliance ** 2))  # Standard deviation.
std_compliance <- dev_compliance / stdev_compliance  # Standard scores.

# Cholesterol as standard scores.
dev_cholesterol <- cholesterol - mean(cholesterol)  # Deviations.
stdev_cholesterol <- sqrt(mean(dev_cholesterol ** 2))  # Standard deviation.
std_cholesterol <- dev_cholesterol / stdev_cholesterol  # Standard scores.

# r value is mean of product for standardized scores.
r <- mean(std_compliance * std_cholesterol)

message('r for compliance / cholesterol is: ', round(r, 2))
```
