Suppose we have 10 measurements of Optical Density on a batch of HIV
negative control samples:

```{r}
density <- c(.02, .026, .023, .017, .022, .019, .018, .018, .017, .022)
```

Derive a 95 percent confidence interval for the sample mean. Are there
enough measurements to produce a satisfactory answer?
