We apply the logic of resampling to the problem of close and distant
planets and their densities.

```{r}
# Steps 1 and 2.
actual_mean_diff <- 8 / 2 - 7 / 3

# Step 3
ranks <- 1:5

n <- 10000

mean_differences <- numeric(n)

for (i in 1:n) {
    # Step 4
    shuffled <- sample(ranks)
    # Step 5
    closer <- shuffled[1:2]  # First 2
    further <- shuffled[3:5] # Last 3
    # Step 6
    mean_close <- mean(closer)
    mean_far <- mean(further)
    # Step 7
    mean_differences[i] <- mean_close - mean_far
}

# Step 9
k <- sum(mean_differences >= actual_mean_diff)
prob <- k / n

message('Proportion of trials with mean difference >= 1.67: ',
        round(prob, 2))
```

Interpretation: 20 percent of the time, random shufflings produced a
difference in ranks as great as or greater than observed. Hence, on the
strength of this evidence, we should *not* conclude that there is a
statistically surprising difference in densities between the further
planets and the closer planets.
